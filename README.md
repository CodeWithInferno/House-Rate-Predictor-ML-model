# House Rate Predictor & Grade Predictor

Welcome to the **House Rate Predictor & Grade Predictor** repository! This project combines two machine learning applications into one repository:

1. **House Rate Predictor**: A sophisticated model to predict house prices based on various housing and demographic features.
2. **Grade Predictor**: A tool to predict student grades based on key academic and demographic data.

Both applications showcase end-to-end machine learning pipelines, starting from data preprocessing to model deployment, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and robust web deployment strategies.

## **Introduction**

This repository demonstrates the application of machine learning to solve real-world problems:

- **House Rate Predictor** uses historical housing data and demographic details to provide accurate house price predictions.
- **Grade Predictor** leverages academic and demographic inputs to estimate student performance metrics.

Both applications highlight the integration of machine learning with Flask-based APIs for seamless interaction and deployment.

## **Project Features**

### **House Rate Predictor**
- Accepts inputs such as:
  - Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
  - Living space in square feet
  - Zip code population and density
  - Median household income
  - Geographical latitude and longitude
- Predicts house prices with high accuracy using Random Forest Regressor.
- Includes advanced feature engineering for better model performance.

### **Grade Predictor**
- Accepts inputs such as:
  - Hours studied
  - Participation in extracurricular activities
  - Past academic performance
  - Demographic data (if applicable)
- Predicts grades using a regression-based approach.
- Implements preprocessing pipelines for feature scaling and encoding.

### Additional Features
- End-to-end ML pipeline design (preprocessing, feature engineering, training, and deployment).

## **Dataset Description**

### **House Rate Predictor Dataset**
- **Source**: American Housing Data (simulated or real-world).
- **Features**:
  - Beds, Baths, Living Space
  - Zip Code Population and Density
  - Median Household Income
  - Latitude and Longitude
  - Derived features: `Baths_per_Bedroom`, `Log_Zip_Code_Population`
- **Target**: House Price

### **Grade Predictor Dataset**
- **Source**: Academic records (simulated or real-world).
- **Features**:
  - Hours Studied, Attendance
  - Participation in Extracurricular Activities
  - Prior GPA or Grades
- **Target**: Predicted Grade

---

## **Technical Workflow**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Numerical columns: Imputed using median values.
  - Categorical columns: Handled using OneHotEncoding.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Ensured unique rows in datasets.
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical data.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- **House Rate Predictor**:
  - Created new features like:
    - `Baths_per_Bedroom` = Baths / (Beds + 1e-6)
    - `Log_Zip_Code_Population` = log(Zip Code Population + 1)
  - Retained essential features and removed redundant ones.
- **Grade Predictor**:
  - Standardized numerical features (e.g., Hours Studied).
  - Encoded categorical features (e.g., participation in extracurricular activities).

### **3. Model Training**
- **House Rate Predictor**:
  - Random Forest Regressor with:
    - 100 estimators
    - Max depth: 10
    - Random state: 42
- **Grade Predictor**:
  - Linear Regression as a baseline model.

### **4. Post-Training Enhancements**
- **Error Analysis**:
  - Evaluated Mean Squared Error (MSE) to refine hyperparameters.
  - Visualized actual vs. predicted values using scatter plots.
- **Model Serialization**:
  - Saved trained models using `joblib` for deployment.

### **5. Web Deployment**
- Built REST APIs using Flask:
  - **/predict (POST)**: Accepts input data as JSON and returns predictions.
- Styled web pages using HTML and CSS for user-friendly input forms.
- Deployed on Render with production-ready configurations using Gunicorn.
